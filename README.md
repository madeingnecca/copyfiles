Overview
========
Sometimes you want to quickly download some files from the webpage you are viewing. Documents, images or other kinds of assets. And sometimes you would like to be able to download these files only from a subset of the page.
Copyfiles will scan the current webpage or selection for tags containing files. Links, images, videos. It works with css values as well, so it will download background images if any.

Installation
============
Create a new bookmark with the contents of copyfiles-bookmarklet.js. Use the new bookmark to download files from a selection or from the entire page. Say goodbye to right-click and "save as".
